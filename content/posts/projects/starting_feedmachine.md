awesomefeedmachine.com has been a side project of mine ever since google shutdown their rss service. I'll be documenting my work on this project here. Now of course there are numerous rss readers apps out there, I just want to try rolling my own.

## The Problem

I haven't yet completed a full rss reader project after years of tinkering. Unless you count my original version which I've lost the code for.

## The Solution

Build something !
