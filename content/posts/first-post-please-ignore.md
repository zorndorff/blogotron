Well , I've finally decided what I'm going to post here. 
The answer is: anything I damn well please. On day 3 of Whole30, 
working on a kubernetes migration project. I have a lot on my mind
and very little concern whether anyone really reads any of this. 
Maybe I'll do a write up on how this site is built eventually. Until then, enjoy my random thoughts.
